# Advanced Monitoring Solution for MERN Application using Grafana and Prometheus
This project involves setting up a robust monitoring solution for a MERN application. The solution includes performance metrics, log aggregation, distributed tracing, alerting, and advanced visualization using Prometheus, Grafana, and other related tools.

# Setps:
1. MERN Application Setup
  Deploy the Travel Memory MERN application locally
  Clone the repository and set up the application.
  Ensure Node.js, MongoDB, and other dependencies are installed.
  Start the application and verify that the frontend, backend, and database are functional.

2. Integrate Prometheus
Backend Metrics
Install the Prometheus Node.js client library:
```
npm install prom-client
```
Expose custom metrics (e.g., API response times, request counts, error rates) in the backend code.
Add an endpoint /metrics to serve Prometheus metrics.

MongoDB Monitoring
Install MongoDB Exporter to collect database metrics.
```
docker run -d -p 9216:9216 --name mongodb-exporter bitnami/mongodb-exporter:latest
```
Configured the MongoDB Exporter to connect to your database.
Prometheus Configuration

Update the Prometheus configuration file (prometheus.yml) to scrape metrics from the Node.js backend and MongoDB Exporter:
```
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'node-backend'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:3001']

  - job_name: 'mongodb'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9216']
```
Restart the Prometheus service to apply the changes.

3. Enhance Grafana Dashboards
Install Grafana and connect it to Prometheus as a data source.
Create advanced dashboards with the following panels:
API response times, request counts, and error rates.
MongoDB health and performance metrics (e.g., query execution times, active connections).
Optional: Include frontend performance metrics if available.

4. Log Aggregation
Install Loki for log aggregation:
```
docker run -d -p 3100:3100 --name loki grafana/loki:latest
```
Configure Promtail to ship logs to Loki:
```
docker run -d -v /var/log:/var/log -p 9080:9080 --name promtail grafana/promtail:latest
```
Integrate Loki with Grafana and create log exploration dashboards.

5. Implement Distributed Tracing
Install Jaeger for distributed tracing:
```
docker run -d --name jaeger -e COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HTTP_PORT=9411 -p 5775:5775/udp -p 6831:6831/udp -p 6832:6832/udp -p 5778:5778 -p 16686:16686 -p 14268:14268 -p 14250:14250 -p 9411:9411 jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
```
Integrate Jaeger into the backend for tracing.
Use the @opentelemetry Node.js SDK to trace API requests.
Connect Jaeger to Grafana as a data source for tracing visualization.

6. Alerting and Anomaly Detection
Set up alerting rules in Prometheus:
```
alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
        - targets:
          - localhost:9093
```
Configure alert thresholds for critical metrics (e.g., high API error rates, slow response times).
Explore Grafanaâ€™s anomaly detection features to detect unusual patterns in metrics and logs.
